# Simple Node Website

- I have created a simple node website to test out my node.js learning in the TOP curriculum. The application creates a server in 8080 port (index.js) and opens index.html as default.
- When the pathname changes to about.html and contact-me.html it reads appropriate files.
- If the pathname entered incorrectly default error page 404 is printed in the screen.

##### To initiate the application in your computer, first clone the repo and use:
```bash
node index.js
```
